## **Introduction**
#### The aim of this project is to address the problem of supporting individuals who have diet sensitivity and health-related issues by developing a combination of technological integration with a health awareness approach. The main objectives include focusing on solving the challenges caused by integrating object detection systems into recommendation systems to provide personal food guidance, formulating an enhanced formula and algorithm capable of recommending the best choice of diet for its end-users, and thereby facilitating users in maintaining controlled diets and a healthy physique. 
#### At 7-Eleven stores in Hong Kong, food recognition software identifies items, helping consumers choose healthier options. This technology utilizes Artificial Intelligence, which employs sophisticated algorithms that can detect and locate objects in images or videos. One instantiation of this technology is the YOLO v4 tiny algorithm. Recommended systems are driven by data science. Hybrid methods use collaborative filtering (which considers user behavior) with content-based filtering (which considers item attributes). These tend to yield accurate suggestions. Knowledge-based systems use explicit health-based rules to provide recommendations.
